Overview
This repository contains a project that performs sentiment analysis on text data using various machine learning models. The goal is to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. Sentiment analysis is widely used in applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and product reviews.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text samples labeled with their corresponding sentiments. Each sample is classified into one of three categories:
Positive: Expresses a favorable sentiment.
Negative: Expresses an unfavorable sentiment.

Features
This project includes:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like Bag of Words.
Model Training: Implementing and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and others.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualizing the results using confusion matrices and accuracy plots.
Modeling Approach

Data Preprocessing:
Remove noise (punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
Tokenize and vectorize the text data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Feature Extraction:
Convert the text data into numerical form using:
Bag of Words (BoW)


Model Training:
Train various machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest

Evaluation: Evaluate models using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix.

The trained models achieved the following performance metrics:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy: 85%, F1-Score: 0.83
Naive Bayes: Accuracy: 82%, F1-Score: 0.80
SVM: Accuracy: 87%, F1-Score: 0.85
Note: These results are based on a specific dataset and may vary depending on the data used.

Future Improvements
Some future enhancements that can be made to this project include:
Advanced NLP Models: Implementing more sophisticated models like LSTM, GRU, or BERT for improved accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Expanding the dataset or using augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.
Deployment: Creating a simple web app for real-time sentiment analysis using Flask or Streamlit.
